Development Guidelines
NO GAMBIARRA POLICY
This codebase follows a strict "no hacks" policy. Code must be:

High quality and clean (not "clean code" dogma, but genuinely simple)
Modular and functional
Fast and efficient (similar quality to professional Rust codebases like dtolnay's crates)
If a task seems impossible or you cannot implement it properly:

DO NOT implement a half-baked solution
Leave code unchanged
Explain the situation honestly
Ask for feedback and clarifications
The user is a domain expert who can provide proper solutions.
